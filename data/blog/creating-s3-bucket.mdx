# Introduction

This guide will walk through the process of creating an S3 bucket on AWS. As well as the process of connecting the S3 bucket to a domain name.

# Optional - DNS

If you have a domain name, we can utilize Route 53 on AWS to setup a hosted zone, to create one, on the AWS console search for Route 53 and select the option from the list.

    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Sid": "PublicReadGetObject",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Principal": "*",
            "Action": "s3:GetObject",
            "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::[example.domain.com]/*"

    ]
}
```

24. Select the bucket from the dropdown list, if it doesn't appear, paste it from the Properties page on the S3 bucket.

An example www subdomain would be example.com compared to www.example.com
