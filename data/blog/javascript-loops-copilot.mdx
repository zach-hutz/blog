# Overview

There are many ways to define loops in Javascript, the most common being a for loop.

For some fun, let's use Github CoPilot to generate this entire script!

---

## Generating a timing function

Let's ask Github Copilot to make us a function to get the precise execution time of another function.

```
function getTime(func) {
    var t0 = performance.now();
    func();
    var t1 = performance.now();
    return t1 - t0;
}
```

Awesome, now we hae a way of timing how long it takes another function to run. Now we need a large array of numbers, so let's ask Copilot to generate that.

---

## Generating a large array

```
var largeArray = [];
    for (var i = 0; i < 1000000; i++) {
    largeArray.push(Math.random());
}
```

Now, let's ask Copilot to compare the execution time of a normal for loop, and .forEach() and .map() and .every() and ()=>{}

---

## For loop

The for loop is the most typical way of performing iteration.

```
function forLoop() {
    var sum = 0;
    for (var i = 0; i < largeArray; i++) {
        sum += i;
    }
 }
```

> 145.59 milliseconds

---

## For each

A for each loop gives you direct access to each item in the array. For each loops also accept a callback function whereas for loops do not.

```
function forEach() {
    var sum = 0;
    largeArray.forEach(function (i) {
        sum += i;
    });
}
```

> 10.79 milliseconds

---

## Map

The map method allows you to iterate over an array and modify its elements using a callback function. The callback function will then be executed on each of the array's elements.

```
function map() {
    var sum = 0;
    largeArray.map(function (i) {
        sum += i;
    });
}
```

> 12.10 milliseconds

---

## Every

In Javascript, every is a method that helps in checking whether elements in a given array satisfies a particular condition mentioned. If all the elements satisfy the condition, then true will be returned, otherwise false will be returned.

```
function every() {
    var sum = 0;
    largeArray.every(function (i) {
        sum += i;
    });
}
```

> 0.09 milliseconds

---

## Arrow function

We can simplify the map function down to a single line by utilizing the arrow function in Javascript, which is denoted with _=>_

```
function arrowFunction() {
    var sum = 0;
    largeArray.map((i) => (sum += i));
}
```

> 30.5 milliseconds

---

## Calling the functions and printing to the console

Now we need to ask Copilot to get the execution time of each function and print it to the console.

```
var timeForLoop = getTime(forLoop);
var timeForEach = getTime(forEach);
var timeMap = getTime(map);
var timeEvery = getTime(every);
var timeArrowFunction = getTime(arrowFunction);

console.log("For Loop: " + timeForLoop);
console.log("For Each: " + timeForEach);
console.log("Map: " + timeMap);
console.log("Every: " + timeEvery);
console.log("Arrow Function: " + timeArrowFunction);
```
