# Spoiler

My solution is posted below, do not continue unless you want the solution to be spoiled.

## Solution

I used time.time() so that my number is constantly getting larger and larger while still keeping a small file size.

```
import time
if __name__ in '__main__':
    for i in range(int(time.time())):
        print(i)
```
