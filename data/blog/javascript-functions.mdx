## Overview

Javascript has multiple ways of specifying and defining functions including a multitude of keywords such as let, const, and function.

Function names can contain letters, digits, underscores, and dollar signs (same rules as variables).

The parentheses may include parameter names separated by commas:
(parameter1, parameter2, ...)

The code to be executed, by the function, is placed inside curly brackets: {}

# Function Declaration

Function Declaration is the traditional way to define a function. It is somehow similar to the way we define a function in other programming languages. We start declaring using the keyword “function”. Then we write the function name and then parameters.

```
function add(a, b) {
  console.log(a+b)
}
```

# Function Expressions

Function Expression is another way to define a function in JavaScript. Here we define a function using a variable and store the returned value in that variable.

```
const add = function(a, b) {
    console.log(a+b);
}
```

```
let add = function(a, b) {
    console.log(a+b);
}
```

```
var add = function(a, b) {
    console.log(a+b);
}
```

# Arrow Functions

Arrow functions are been introduced in the [ES6 version](https://www.w3schools.com/Js/js_es6.asp) of JavaScript. It is used to shorten the code. Here we do not use the “function” keyword and instead use the arrow symbol.

```
let add = (a, b) => a + b;
```

```
const add = (a, b) => a + b;
```

```
const add = (a, b, c) => {
    return a+b/c
};
```
